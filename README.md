<!---
I am an 80 year old man who retired at the age of 70 after a career at RCA and Unisys, and I need to get my brain active again.
In my career I have used the following languages: Cobol, Fortran, (IBM 360/RCA 70-45 Masm), x86 masm  (Unisys 2200 masm), C, C++, C#, Visual Basic. 
Most of my life I have worked on Mainframe Diagnostics and embedded X86 code and some SQL.
